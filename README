Node-Social-Auth-Boilerplate
============================

Fully working social authorization example in Node with Express that includes persistence, Mongoose and connect-mongodb.

This code takes various examples from the DailyJS node tutorial series, the everyauth & mongoose-auth github pages and pieces it all together for a fully working login system.

You should be able to install all modules as is EXCEPT for the mongoose-auth google library. That is custom and you will need to drop it into your mongoose-auth install.
