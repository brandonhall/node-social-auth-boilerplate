# Node-Social-Auth-Boilerplate

Fully working social authorization example in Node with Express that includes persistence, Mongoose and connect-mongodb.

## Features

* Initial role setting in the default setup.
* Add Facebook and/or Google user to MongoDB
* Amend user Mongo document instead of new document
* Persistence on server restart via connect-mongodb
* Google OAuth 2.0 aka Google+ Integration
* Pass `req.user` to the Jade file via ExpressHelpers

This code takes various examples from the DailyJS node tutorial series, the everyauth & mongoose-auth github pages and pieces it all together for a fully working login system.

## Install Notes

You may require some dependencies depending on your setup. Express should warn you about what is missing. This is more copy/paste for your situation than a true boilerplate.

## Mongoose-Auth

You will need to drop the [Mongoose-Auth Google Module](https://github.com/brandonhall/node-social-auth-boilerplate/tree/master/node_modules/mongoose-auth/lib/modules/google) into your setup because it's not included in the standard Mongoose-Auth package.

## Credits
